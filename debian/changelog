libspectre (0.2.3-0.1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

  [ Pino Toscano ]
  * Drop the Ghostscript headers removal, as upstream does not ship them
    anymore, and consequently the "Debian source" suffix.
    + adapt the watch file to not mangle the 'ds' suffix.
  * Disable the update of the autotools build system, no more needed now
    (as it is not changed).
  * Do not require and use quilt, as we have no more patches to apply.
  * Add a versioned shlibs.
